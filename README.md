# aicp-week-5
The organizer of a senior citizensâ€™ club arranges outings for the members. For each of these outings, a coach is hired, meals at a restaurant are reserved and tickets for the theatre are booked. A program is required to work out the costs and provide a printed list showing everyone on the outing.
